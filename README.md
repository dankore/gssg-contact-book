## On a mission to empower GSS Gwarinpa present and past students

Welcome to the community of GSS Gwarinpa!

## Who we are

We are a group of current and past students who have come together to create a space where you can connect with one another, find new friends, discover new opportunities for adventure, and communicate with your fellow alumni.

## Are you new here?

If you're new here, you should know that we love our school and want to make sure it stays strong as we move forward into the future. We also have some fun traditions that we hope you'll enjoy joining us for over the years.

If you're an alumnus of this school or current student, we hope you'll join us in keeping up with what's going on here by registering on our site. It's free, easy to do, and helps us ensure that everyone has access to all the information they need about their alma mater.

This is your chance to reconnect with school mates!
